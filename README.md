# Aeroplane-Chess

Aeroplane Chess is a game developed in the 20th century and resembles Ludo, Sorry!, or the much older Pachisi. It's a 2 to 4 player game involving rolling a die and moving pieces around a track to reach their goal.

# Rules

Players have 4 pieces(represented by planes, hence the game of the game), which start in their hangar. The player rolls a 6-sided die. If they roll a 5 or 6, they may deploy a piece from their hangar onto the board track. Otherwise, they must move one of their already deployed pieces a number of spaces equal to the result counterclockwise along the board track. If they land on an enemy piece, the enemy piece is sent back to their hangar. If the space they landed on matches their color, the piece immediately moves to the next space of their color (and sending back any enemy pieces at that space as well). There are also flight spaces which allows the player to move to the corresponding space for the flight space rather than simply the next space of the same color, moving the piece much further along the track. 

If the player rolled a 6, they take another turn. However, if they rolled three 6's in a row, the two pieces (or one if they moved the same piece twice) are sent back to the hangar and their turn ends immediately. The goal of the game is for a player to move all of their pieces around the board onto the ladder of their color and reach the end. Pieces on the ladder can only move with the full value of the die so if there's less spaces then the die result, the pieces may not move. There is also a spot on the ladder where a piece will be sent back to the hangar if an opponent uses a flight space that runs through the ladder.

# Simplified Version

The basic track is reduced from 52 spaces plus the ladder to 20 spaces, no flight spaces, and no ladder. Players also only need to move 3 pieces counterclockwise around the board and return home.
